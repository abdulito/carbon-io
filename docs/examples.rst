Examples
====================

Learning by example is a great way to learn a new framework. We have create a set of examples
in Github to help you understand how to use Carbon.io.

* `Hello World <https://github.com/carbon-io-examples/example__hello-world-service/tree/carbon-0.6>`_ - A simple
  Hello World service.

* `Simple Command-line App
  <https://github.com/carbon-io-examples/example__simple-cmdline-app/tree/carbon-0.6>`_ - A simple
  command-line application.

* `Test Suites
  <https://github.com/carbon-io-examples/example__test-suites/tree/carbon-0.6>`_ - This example illustrates
  how to make test suites using ``test-tube``.

* `Parameter Parsing
  <https://github.com/carbon-io-examples/example__hello-world-service-parameter-parsing/tree/carbon-0.6>`_ - A
  Hello World service that illustrates the use of parameter and response definitions.

* `Microservice chaining
  <https://github.com/carbon-io-examples/example__hello-world-service-chaining/tree/carbon-0.6>`_ - A
  Hello World service. This example illustrates microservice chaining/proxying where one microservice
  uses another microservice as part of its implementation.

* `API Key Authentication
  <https://github.com/carbon-io-examples/example__hello-world-service-aac/tree/carbon-0.6>`_ - A
  Hello World service. This example illustrates the central ideas of authentication and access control.
  API key authentication is implemented by ``MongoDBApiKeyAuthenticator`` and access control is defined
  in an ``ACL``.

* `MongoDB
  <https://github.com/carbon-io-examples/example__hello-world-service-mongodb/tree/carbon-0.6>`_ - A Hello World service.
  This example illustrates:

    * how to build services with multiple endpoints using multiple modules / source files
    * how to interact with MongoDB
    * the use of exceptions for communicating HTTP errors to the client
    * the use of sub-endpoints and path parameters
    * the use of environment variables

* `Zipcode service <https://github.com/carbon-io-examples/example__zipcode-service/tree/carbon-0.6>`_ - A service for
  managing zipcodes. This example illustrates the use of
  ``MongoDBCollection``\s to create microservices.

* `Contacts API <https://github.com/carbon-io-examples/contacts-service-advanced/tree/carbon-0.6>`_ - A service for
  managing contacts. The API provides for the management of users and
  allows each user to manage their own set of contacts. This example
  illustrates advanced use of ``Collection``\s, ``Authenticator``\s,
  and ``ACL``\s.
