Learning by example is a great way to learn a new framework. We have create a set of examples 
in Github to help you understand how to use Carbon.io.

* `Hello world <http://github.com/carbon-io/example__hello-world-service>`_ - A simple 
  Hello World service. 

* `Simple commandline app
  <http://github.com/carbon-io/example__simple-cmdline-app>`_ - A simple
  commandline application.

* `Zipcode service <http://github.com/carbon-io/example__zipcode-service>`_ - A service for 
  managing zipcodes. This example illustrates the use of
  ``MongoDBCollection``\s to create microservices. 

* `Contacts API <http://github.com/carbon-io/example__contacts-api>`_ - A service for
  managing contacts. The API provides for the management of users and
  allows each user to manage their own set of contacts. This example
  illustrates advanced use of ``Collection``\s, ``Authenticator``\s,
  and ``ACL``\s.
